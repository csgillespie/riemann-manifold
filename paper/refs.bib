@article{Milner2011,
abstract = {Stochastic models are often used when modelling chemical species that have low numbers of molecules, see [1]. However, as these models become large, it can become computationally expensive to simulate even a single realisation of the system. Since even efficient simulation techniques have a high computational cost. One possible technique to approximate the stochastic system is moment closure. The moment closure approximation is used to provide analytic approximations to non-linear stochastic models. Until now, this approximation has only been applied to models with polynomial rate laws. In this paper we extend the moment closure method to cover models with rational rate laws.},

@article{Gillespie2009,
abstract = {Although stochastic population models have proved to be a powerful tool in the study of process generating mechanisms across a wide range of disciplines, all too often the associated mathematical development involves nonlinear mathematics, which immediately raises difficult and challenging analytic problems that need to be solved if useful progress is to be made. One approximation that is often employed to estimate the moments of a stochastic process is moment closure. This approximation essentially truncates the moment equations of the stochastic process. A general expression for the marginal- and joint-moment equations for a large class of stochastic population models is presented. The generalisation of the moment equations allows this approximation to be applied easily to a wide range of models. Software is available from http://pysbml.googlecode.com/ to implement the techniques presented here.},
