\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

\begin{itemize}
\item Inference for MJP is difficult: non-linear likelihood, computational
  expensive, proposals expensive, analytically intractable likelihood
\item Data: Partially observed discrete, noisy time-course.
\item Existing work for likelihood evaluations: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Likelihood calculations
\begin{itemize}
\item Exact: Boys et al, slow, not noise
\item Approx SDE - Andy and Darren (with Noise)
\item Approx MC - Andy and Colin (no noise)
\item Approx LNA - Mark (no noise), Kolmo' (no noise, but check)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Novel stuff
\end{itemize}
Different from Mark's LNA paper:
\begin{itemize}
\item Analysis of impact of the approximate proposal scheme
\item Using Noise
\item Using delayed acceptance scheme so exact inference
\item Time course data
\item Using real data
\end{itemize}

Importance of stochastic population models for further scientific understanding of natural systems vs deterministic models.  For example in ecology, where we often have to deal with discrete noisy data.  Importance of parametric sensitivity has already been shown for determining vital properties of biological systems such as robustness and also in experimental design where the sensitivity gives information about the identifiability of individual rate constants.

The sensitivity of parameters is also of central importance when inferring unknown parameter values for a mathematical model

Performing exact inference over stochastic kinetic models described by Markov Jump Processes is extremely difficult.  First and foremost, the likelihood is usually analytically intractable for models with levels of complexity suitable for describing natural phenomena.

Approximations of the likelihood surface, such as LNA and moment closure.  Parameter inference - want to explore the likelihood surface - can consider it as a Riemannian manifold.  This manifold is an approximation of the true underlying Riemannian manifold of the analytically intractable likelihood.

\section{Example}

\subsection{Immigration-death}

\begin{itemize}
\item Comparison between Riemannian MC proposal, LNA proposal and true proposal
\item Comparison between Riemannian and MH
\item A single example, with highly correlated parameters
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SIR (type) model}

\begin{itemize}
\item Use model from Stumpf ABC paper (with real data?)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Aphid data set}

\begin{itemize}
\item 36 parameters - 18 birth, 18 death. 3 water treatments, 3 nitrogen treatments and 3 blocks, with interactions
\item 5*27 (I think) latent data sets
\item Exploit Sub-mannifolds for choosing parameter sets
\item Poisson error structure
\end{itemize}


\section{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Use of geometry vital in tackling real problems
\item Could also use other approximation schemes such as the LNA??

%% PNAS does not support submission of supporting .tex files such as BibTeX.
%% Instead all references must be included in the article .tex document. 
%% If you currently use BibTeX, your bibliography is formed because the

%% Adding Figure and Table References
%% Be sure to add figures and tables after \end{article}

%% For Tables, put caption above table

%% Table caption should start with a capital letter, continue with lower case
